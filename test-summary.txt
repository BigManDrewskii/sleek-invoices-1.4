AUTH Integration Fix - Summary
====================================

✅ COMPLETED FIXES:
1. Restored api/index.js (CRITICAL - unblocks /api/* routes)
2. Built application successfully (dist/_server/index.js generated)
3. Fixed cookie sameSite for localhost (sessions now work in dev)
4. Fixed environment variable naming (checks BETTER_AUTH_URL || AUTH_URL)
5. Added OAuth provider validation (graceful degradation)
6. Fixed logout cookie name (now clears correct session)

⚠️ ADDITIONAL ISSUE FOUND:
- /api/health endpoint: 200 ✓
- /api/auth/sign-out (POST): 200 ✓
- /api/auth/callback/google: 302 ✓ (OAuth redirects work)
- /api/auth/session: 404 ✗
- /api/auth/providers: 404 ✗
- /api/auth/sign-in/google: 404 ✗

ANALYSIS:
- Express app is deployed and running correctly
- Auth handler is working for OAuth callbacks
- SOME Better Auth v1.5 endpoints are NOT exposed or not working

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. Better Auth v1.5 changed endpoint names/paths
2. These endpoints require specific configuration to enable
3. Need to check Better Auth v1.5 documentation
4. May need to upgrade to stable Better Auth version

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check Better Auth v1.5.0-beta.9 documentation
2. Verify if endpoints are configured correctly
3. May need to add additional configuration options
4. Consider upgrading to stable Better Auth version
